### Making dev changes to frida-tools

**You do not need to build this repo** in order to make changes (for a pull
request, or for local development).

Simply set your PYTHONPATH environment variable to wherever you've cloned
this repo to.

For example, on Windows, assuming you clone to `C:\src`:

    git clone https://github.com/frida/frida-tools.git
    cd frida-tools
    SET PYTHONPATH=C:\src\frida-tools

Now when you run frida.exe, these scripts and any changes you make will be
referenced instead!
